# Screening_of_pulmonary_tuberculosis_based_on_chest_radiographs
Platform that has been used is google_colaboratory
I had accessed the dataset to the colaboratory using the google drive 
Developed the model required for screening using keras
After the model training and testing is finished, you can upload a desired chest radiograph to say whether person is affected from tuberculosis or not.
